# C-SharpFundamentals1
Welcome to MyCSharpJourney! This is my personal repository for documenting my learning journey with C# programming language. Here, I share my progress, code examples, and insights as I dive into the fundamentals of C# coding.

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises related to C# fundamentals. These projects cover various aspects of C# programming, including data types, control flow statements, exception handling, loops, and more.

Projects
ClassConstructorMethods: This project explores how to use constructors in C# classes to create instances of those classes.
Decisions: This project covers decision-making in C# using if statements, switch statements, and ternary operators.
Exercise1: This project includes several exercises related to C# fundamentals, such as working with data types, operators, and control statements.
HelloWorld: This is a simple project that displays "Hello World" on the console.
IntroToDataTypes: This project provides an overview of C# data types, including numbers, strings, and boolean values.
IntroToMathOperators: This project explores basic arithmetic operations in C# using math operators such as +, -, *, /, and %.
IntroToMethods: This project introduces C# methods and how to define and call them.
IntroToVariables: This project covers variables in C# and how to declare and initialize them.
OperatorsExpressionsStatements: This project covers C# operators, expressions, and statements, including assignment, increment/decrement, and conditional operators.
TryCatchFinallyStatements: This project explores exception handling in C# using try-catch-finally statements.
WorkingWithStrings: This project covers C# strings, including string manipulation, formatting, and concatenation.
captureUserInput: This project shows how to capture user input in C# using the Console.ReadLine() method.
intoToSacks: This project introduces C# stacks and how to use them.
introToArrays: This project provides an overview of C# arrays and how to work with them.
introToExceptionHandling: This project covers C# exception handling and how to catch and handle exceptions.
introToForAndForeachLoops: This project explores C# for and foreach loops and how to use them.
introToIf-ElseStatements: This project covers C# if-else statements and how to use them for decision-making.
introToLinkedList: This project introduces C# linked lists and how to use them.
introToLists: This project covers C# lists and how to work with them.
introToQueues: This project explores C# queues and how to use them.
introToRandomization: This project covers C# randomization and how to generate random numbers.
introToRecursion: This project introduces recursion in C# and how to use it.
introToSwitchStatements: This project covers C# switch statements and how to use them for decision-making.
introToWhileAndDoWhileLoops: This project explores C# while and do-while loops and how to use them.
randomListOfNumbers: This project generates a list of random numbers in C#.
Other Files
.gitattributes: This file specifies attributes that are applied to files when they are committed to the repository.
.gitignore: This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored when committing changes to the repository.
C-SharpFundamentals1.sln: This is the solution file for the C-SharpFundamentals1 project.
All project files and other files have been added to this repository. The projects were completed in the past week or so and are designed to provide a solid foundation in C# programming fundamentals.
